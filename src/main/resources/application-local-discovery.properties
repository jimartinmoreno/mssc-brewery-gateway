# Map of availability zone to list of fully qualified URLs to communicate with eureka server. Each value can be a single URL \
#  or a comma separated list of alternative locations. Typically the eureka server URLs carry protocol,host,port,context and \
#  version information if any. Example: https://ec2-256-156-243-129.compute-1.amazonaws.com:7001/eureka/ The changes are effective \
#  at runtime at the next service url refresh cycle as specified by eurekaServiceUrlPollIntervalSeconds.
